\section{Notes on the assignment}
\label{sec:notes_on_ass}

None of the assignments for the Software Architectures course were submitted in the first examination period due to personal reasons.
Because of this, all of the code written for this assignment is written specifically for the second examination period.
One small \textit{bug} in the code was resolved after email communication with the teaching assistants.
This \textit{bug} and its solution will be explained later.
All other code was written by using the course material and the online Akka documentation\footnote{\url{https://akka.io/docs/}}.
